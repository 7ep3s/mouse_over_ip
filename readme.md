I am lazy anc cba to move the dongle of my G502 between all the computers I use at my desk.

and I have a pi 3 that's doing nothing.

so I made this.

you plug the dongle into the pi.

configure the computer details in pi_mouse_server.py

hook up a push button to gpio 10.

start pi_mouse_server.py.

start client.py on all the computers you configured.

enjoy.
